Scrimba - Solo project

This was a project that I completd on Scrimba as part of the course. 

I went back to the design of this and wrote this from scratch without the assistance of the tutorial. I used what I learnt and google to work my way through the build.

My main learning from this project:

Javascript - 
  Math.random & Math.Floor
  For of (for Loops) - big fan of this new method. Much cleaner code
  if staments
  using boleen's to help active functions and to stop buttons from continuing to fire afer the condition has been met
  
 UI - 
   Pleased that I have created visual higherarchy. 
   White space is ideal.
   Happy with scale & respositivity.
   Used only 1 font type to maintain design
   good contrast between background and main section
